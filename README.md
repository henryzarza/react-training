# react-training

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- This project is a simple application using React (with hooks, portals, and context), this app is just a demo to connect GraphQL APIs to React apps.
- The GraphQL server used is [graphcountries](https://github.com/lennertVanSever/graphcountries). Thank you so much [lennerVanServer](https://github.com/lennertVanSever) for the amazing server it was really helpful.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test` and `yarn coverage-diff`

If you want to run all the tests you have to check on `testing` branch (see [PR 26](https://github.com/henryzarza/react-training/pull/26)) and run `yarn test` for running the current tests no stacked and run `yarn coverage-diff` if you want to see the coverage and all the tests.
I did 26 tests and 8 test suites, I have a problem with `am4chart` library with the tests but I left a TODO for doing it later.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
