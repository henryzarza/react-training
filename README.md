# react-training

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- This project is a simple application using React (with hooks, portals, and context), this app is just a demo to connect GraphQL APIs to React apps.
- The GraphQL server used is [graphcountries](https://github.com/lennertVanSever/graphcountries). Thank you so much [lennerVanServer](https://github.com/lennertVanSever) for the amazing server it was really helpful.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

I'll do it in the future üëÄüôá

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
